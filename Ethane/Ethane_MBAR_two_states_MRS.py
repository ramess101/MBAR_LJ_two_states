"""
Predicts the internal energy for a new model (Potoff or Mess-UP) using simulation
just for the initial model (TraPPE). The TraPPE and Mess-UP models represent
an example of very good phase space overlap as they are very similar LJ models.
The Potoff model has very poor phase space overlap having a different value
of sigma and a repulsive exponent of 16. 

The primary conclusion is that for Potoff the number of effective samples is
around 1, which explains the poor prediction for MBAR. However, when using
"MBAR_alt" the prediction is better than "MBAR" and just rerunning the simulation
(i.e. a weighting of 1 for all configurations). The question is, is MBAR or
MBAR_alt the correct implementation of MBAR?

In addition, it is unclear why the prediction of U from MBAR for the Mess-UP 
model is worse than just rerunning the simulation (again, a weighting of 1 for
all configurations). This is surprising as the number of effective samples
is much larger for the Mess-UP model (around 500).
